# Aether VPN (Android)

Flutter Android client for [Aether](https://github.com/CluvexStudio/Aether): connects through aether and routes the whole device through it as a VPN.

Build: run `fetch_aether.sh` (downloads aether, builds hev-socks5-tunnel with the NDK), then `flutter build apk`.

## Core v2.3.0 update

The Android binaries were refreshed from the official v2.3.0 release for
arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a and x86_64, with archive SHA-256 verification. Aether,
Lyrebird and Psiphon were updated together; the existing hev-socks5-tunnel
build is unchanged.

In v2.3, `--gool` means WireGuard inside MASQUE. Existing WARP-in-WARP
presets now use `--gool-classic`, preserving their saved indexes and behavior.
New WireGuard-in-MASQUE and WireGuard-in-MASQUE HTTP/2 presets are appended
and are also eligible for Auto. Additional TLS/ECH and Psiphon options remain
accessible through Core settings; consult the bundled core's help for syntax.

## Core feature access

The protocol menu includes MASQUE HTTP/3 and HTTP/2, HTTP/2 fragmentation,
WireGuard, nested WireGuard/MASQUE, standalone Tor/Psiphon, WARP through
Tor/Psiphon, and Tor/Psiphon through WARP. Forward modes route the Android VPN
and HTTP latency check through the secondary exit, not the base WARP listener.
Existing saved protocol indexes are preserved. Auto includes the fast H2 fallbacks;
Tor/Psiphon remain manual because bootstrap can take minutes.

Open **Core settings** while disconnected to configure additional arguments as a
JSON string array and `AETHER_*` / `RUST_LOG` environment variables as a JSON
object. This exposes scanning, obfuscation, DNS, endpoints, routing, upstream
proxies, TLS/ECH, Zero Trust, bridges, Psiphon region/fronting, diagnostics and
resource tuning supported by the bundled binary. The page displays that binary's
own `--help`; upstream documentation can describe a different version.

Example arguments (select MASQUE HTTP/2 first):

```json
["--fragment", "--scan", "balanced", "--noize", "gfw", "--stats"]
```

Arguments are passed without a shell, preserving spaces in bridge lines and
paths. App-owned protocol flags, listeners and helper paths cannot be overridden.
CLI flags take precedence over environment settings. Advanced startup timeout
applies when custom arguments/environment are nonempty. **Core input** sends a
response to the current process, including an emailed Zero Trust code, without
logging the response. Input is discarded if the process changed in the meantime.

### Limits (not a claim of complete feature parity)

- Expert options are not individually validated against the bundled core. Choose
  compatible settings; errors are reported in the persistent log.
- Settings are in app-private JSON, not encrypted storage. Core logs can expose
  sensitive data, especially at debug/trace level.
- File-based options require existing app-accessible files; there is no file
  import/export UI or standalone registration workflow yet.
- `SO_MARK` needs root/capabilities. Extra pluggable transport binaries must be
  packaged for Android. Fetch the core binaries before building a fresh checkout.
- The Android VPN frontend remains IPv4-only; core IPv6 endpoint selection is
  separate. This change does not add IPv6 VPN transport or verify leak prevention.
- Tor/reverse modes are TCP-only; they do not make UDP-only apps work through Tor.
- Selecting direct routes intentionally bypasses the tunnel. Organization Gateway
  can apply organization logging/filtering.
- Live end-to-end protocol coverage requires an Android device and reachable
  networks/accounts. Unit/widget tests only verify settings, argument generation
  and responsive layout, not that every protocol successfully connects.

Run checks with `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.
